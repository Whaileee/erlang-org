## OTP 28.0-rc3

Erlang/OTP 28.0-rc3 is the third release candidate of before the OTP 28.0 release.

The intention with this release is to get feedback from our users.
All feedback is welcome, even if it is only to say that it works for you,
and that it installs as it should.
We encourage users to try it out and give us feedback either by creating an issue at
[https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues](https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues) or by
posting to [Erlang Forums](https://erlangforums.com/).

All artifacts for the release can be downloaded from the
[Erlang/OTP Github](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-28.0-rc3) release
and you can view the new documentation at
[https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-16-rc3/doc](https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-16-rc3/doc/).
You can also install the latest release using [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl) like this:

```
kerl build 28.0-rc3 28.0-rc3.
```

Starting with this release, a source [Software Bill of Materials
(SBOM)](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/sbom-types-document-508c.pdf)
will describe the release on the [Github
Releases](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases) page. We welcome
feedback on the SBOM.

Erlang/OTP 28 is a new major release with new features, improvements
as well as a few incompatibilities. Some of the new features are
highlighted below.

Many thanks to all contributors!


# Highlights for RC2

- Functionality making it possible for processes to enable reception of
  [priority messages](https://erlang.org/doc/system/ref_man_processes.html#priority-messages) has been introduced in accordance with
  [EEP 76](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0076).

# Highlights for RC1

## New language features

- Comprehensions have been extended with "zip generators" allowing
  multiple generators to be run in parallel. For example,
  `[A+B || A <- [1,2,3] && B <- [4,5,6]]` will produce `[5,7,9]`.

- Generators in comprehensions can now be strict, meaning that if
  the generator pattern does not match, an exception will be raised
  instead of silently ignore the value that didn't match.

- It is now possible to use any base for floating point numbers as per
  [EEP 75: Based Floating Point Literals](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0075).


## Compiler and JIT improvements

- For certain types of errors, the compiler can now suggest
  corrections.  For example, when attempting to use variable `A` that
  is not defined but `A0` is, the compiler could emit the following
  message: `variable 'A' is unbound, did you mean 'A0'?`

- The size of an atom in the Erlang source code was limited to 255
  bytes in previous releases, meaning that an atom containing only
  emojis could contain only 63 emojis. While atoms are still only
  allowed to contain 255 characters, the number of bytes is no longer
  limited.

- The `warn_deprecated_catch` option enables warnings for use of
  old-style catch expressions on the form `catch Expr` instead of the
  modern `try` ... `catch` ... `end`.

- Provided that the map argument for a `maps:put/3` call is known to
  the compiler to be a map, the compiler will replace such calls with
  the corresponding update using the map syntax.

- Some BIFs with side-effects (such as `binary_to_atom/1`) are
  optimized in `try` ... `catch` in the same way as guard BIFs in
  order to gain performance.

- The compilerâ€™s alias analysis pass is now both faster and less
  conservative, allowing optimizations of records and binary
  construction to be applied in more cases.

## ERTS

- The `trace:system/3` function has been added. It has a similar
  interface as `erlang:system_monitor/2` but it also supports trace
  sessions.

- `os:set_signal/2` now supports setting handlers for the `SIGWINCH`,
  `SIGCONT`, and `SIGINFO` signals.

- The two new BIFs `erlang:processes_iterator/0` and
  `erlang:process_next/1` make it possible to iterate over the
  process table in a way that scales better than `erlang:processes/0`.

## Shell and terminal

- The erl -noshell mode has been updated to have two sub modes called
  `raw` and `cooked`, where `cooked` is the old default behaviour and
  `raw` can be used to bypass the line-editing support of the native
  terminal. Using `raw` mode it is possible to read keystrokes as they
  occur without the user having to press Enter. Also, the `raw` mode
  does not echo the typed characters to stdout.

- The shell now prints a help message explaining how to interrupt a
  running command when stuck executing a command for longer than 5
  seconds.

## STDLIB

- The `join(Binaries, Separator)` function that joins a list of
  binaries has been added to the
  [`binary`](https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-16-rc2/lib/stdlib-7.0/doc/html/binary.html) module.

- By default, sets created by module
  [`sets`](https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-16-rc2/lib/stdlib-7.0/doc/html/sets.html)
  will now be represented as maps.

- Module [`re`](https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-16-rc2/lib/stdlib-7.0/doc/html/re.html) has
  been updated to use the newer PCRE2 library instead of the
  PCRE library.

- There is a new `zstd` module that does
  [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) compression.


## Dialyzer

- [EEP 69: Nominal Types](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0069) has been
  implemented.

## SSL

- The data handling for tls-v1.3 has been optimized.

## Emacs mode (in the Tools application)

- The `indent-region` in Emacs command will now handle multiline
  strings better.
