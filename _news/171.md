## OTP 27.1

Erlang/OTP 27.1 is the first maintenance patch package for OTP 27, with mostly bug fixes as well as improvements.

### Highlights

* The [`zip`](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/zip.html) module has been updated with support for:

  - zip64 archives - Archives larger than 4GB or with more than 2^32 entries.
  - extended timestamps - Higher resolution and in UTC.
  - UID/GID - Save and extract the original UID/GID.
  - Fixes so that permission mode attributes are correctly read and set for
    files in archives.
  - [`zip:list_dir/2`](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/zip.html#list_dir/2) now also returns directories, not only files. (You can disable this behaviour by using the option `skip_directories`).

* All releases now have `.zip` versions of the Windows installer that can be used to install Erlang/OTP on Windows when you do not have administrator priviliges. You can download it from erlang.org/downloads or from https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases.

  Various bugs in the original implementation have also been fixed, such as:

  - Correctly encoding and decoding the DOS timestamps for entries within an archive
    (that is the non-extended timestamp).
  - Fixed DOS timestamps to be set to localtime instead of UTC (use extended
    timestamps for UTC timestamps).
  - Used the unix file attributes read from disk when creating archives instead
    of setting everything to 644.


### Potential incompatibilities:

* Progress reports for a dynamically started supervisor will now be logged at
  debug level.

For details about bugfixes and potential incompatibilities see
